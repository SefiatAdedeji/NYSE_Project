# NYSE_Project
NYSE Data Project Using Excel

### Task 1:
a.	Identify the question about the data that you will answer based on your data analysis and include this in your slide presentation.
•	Your question should include at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (one of the financial metrics) and require the use of at least one of the summary statistics.
•	A tab within the Excel spreadsheets that you submit should include the summary statistics [measures of central tendency and measures of spread]

### Task 2:
Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list. Include all companies from the raw data.
### Task 3:
•	Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of your choice that forecasts out the Gross profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two or more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case)
•	Your assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin should change for each scenario
•	The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). However, the forecasting model can be static for the chosen company sticker symbol.

### Findings:
For the Histograms for Year 1 and Year 4 showing the Average Total Performance of GICS Sectors 
* The Two distributions are both positively Skewed because their Mean is greater than their median
* The Mean for GICS Sector Average Total revenue for year 1 is ($23513677745) while the mean for year 4 is ($24117987019), which is higher compared to that of year 1.  This shows that across the sub industry, Year 4 has higher Total Revenue on average than all the Sub industry in Year 1.
* The Median of Average Total Revenue for Year 4 was higher ($23259830581) compared to Median of Average Total revenue for year 1(($21433339576)). This shows that the median of average Total Revenue for year 4 is almost doubled the median of average Total Revenue for Year 1
* The Average Total Revenue has a significant range of ($34677690715) for year 1 and a Range of ($38265171192) for Year 4, this implies that the sub industry in Year 4 have greater variability in the average Total Revenue because their range is more spread out.
* There is an increase of about $1 billion in our Standard deviation, with a standard deviation of ($3053338003) in year 1 while is ($31830040980) in Year 4. This shows that across the sub industry that the revenue is widely spread out from the mean.
